# Link

<ImportPath path="import { Link } from 'cx/widgets';" />

Links are used for `pushState` navigation between pages. The `Link` component renders an anchor element that integrates with CxJS routing.

<CodeExample code={LinkExampleCode}>
  <LinkExample client:load />
</CodeExample>

## Active State

Links can automatically detect when they point to the current page and apply additional styling. Use `activeClass` or `activeStyle` to highlight active links in navigation menus. The `match` property controls how the URL is compared:

- `equal` (default) - Link is active only when URLs match exactly
- `prefix` - Link is active when `href` is a prefix of the current URL
- `subroute` - Like `prefix`, but requires a `/` after the match (indicating a subroute)

## Configuration

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `href` | `string` | URL to the link's target location. Use `~/` or `#/` prefix for pushState/hash based navigation. Use `+/` prefix for URLs relative to the parent route. |
| `url` | `string` | Binding to the current URL location in the store. If `href` matches `url`, the `active` CSS class is applied. |
| `match` | `string` | Determines how `href` is matched against `url` to detect active state. Supported values are `equal` (default), `prefix`, and `subroute`. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Set to `true` to disable the link. |
| `target` | `string` | Specifies where to open the linked document (e.g., `_blank`). |
| `activeClass` | `string \| object` | Additional CSS class applied when the link is active. |
| `activeStyle` | `string \| object` | Additional CSS style applied when the link is active. |
| `inactiveClass` | `string \| object` | Additional CSS class applied when the link is not active. |
| `inactiveStyle` | `string \| object` | Additional CSS style applied when the link is not active. |
| `baseClass` | `string` | Base CSS class. Default is `link`. |
