# Breaking Changes

Sometimes we are forced to introduce breaking changes to the framework.
This page will provide information about breaking changes and how to migrate your applications to the latest
versions of the framework.

## 26.1.0

### TypeScript Migration

The CxJS framework has been fully migrated to TypeScript. This is a major change that brings improved type safety, better IDE support, and enhanced developer experience.

### Separation from React JSX Types

CxJS now provides its own JSX type definitions instead of relying on React's JSX types. This separation was necessary because CxJS JSX has fundamental differences from React JSX.

To use the new JSX types, update your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "cx"
  }
}
```

With this configuration, TypeScript will use CxJS-specific JSX types, providing proper type checking for CxJS attributes and components.

### Package Upgrades Required

The following packages have been updated and should be upgraded to version 26.x:

| Package                             | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `cx`                                | Core framework package                      |
| `cx-react`                          | React adapter (now written in TypeScript)   |
| `babel-plugin-transform-cx-imports` | Babel plugin for optimizing imports         |
| `swc-plugin-transform-cx-jsx`       | SWC plugin for CxJS JSX transformation      |
| `swc-plugin-transform-cx-imports`   | SWC plugin for optimizing imports           |
| `cx-scss-manifest-webpack-plugin`   | Webpack plugin for SCSS manifest generation |

<Note type="warning">
  Some projects have copied `cx-scss-manifest-webpack-plugin` and used it in
  source form. These projects should now transition to using the official npm
  package instead. These versions will not work with the 26.x releases due to
  internal path changes and CSS will appear broken. Alternatively, the plugin
  can be patched to use the `build` folder instead of the `src` folder to detect
  which components are actually being used in the project.
</Note>

### React 18+ Required

CxJS 26.x requires React 18 or later. The framework now uses the modern React 18 APIs including `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`. If your application is still using React 17 or earlier, you will need to upgrade React before upgrading to CxJS 26.x.

### Migration Guide

For a comprehensive guide on migrating your applications to TypeScript and taking advantage of the new type system, please refer to the [Migration Guide](/intro/migration-guide).

## 24.10.0

### Legend and LegendEntry rendering

Legend and LegendEntry components have been refactored to use the flexbox layout. This change might affect the appearance
if you have custom styles applied to these components.

## 24.5.1

### Default Window body padding

The Window body now have a default padding. Previously, a few options were used to add padding such as
`bodyStyle`, `bodyClass`, or adding margin/padding to the inner content.
All these options lead to problems with layout consistency across different themes.

If you want to revert to the old behavior, you can set the `pad` property to `false` on the prototype of the Window widget.
This will effectively remove the default padding from the Window body, unless `pad` is explicitly set to `true` on the Window.

```javascript
import { Window } from "cx/widgets";
Window.prototype.pad = false;
```

Alternatively, you can reset the Sass variable to remove default padding, before importing the CxJS variables.

```scss
$cx-default-window-body-padding: 0;

@import "~cx/src/variables";
```

However, the best way forward would be to go through your codebase and remove `bodyStyle`, `bodyClass` values, or padding/margins used for this purpose
within the window content.

## 23.2.0

### Dropped support for Internet Explorer

If you need to support Internet Explorer please use an older version of CxJS.

### Dart Sass Transition

CxJS theming support is based on Sass. Since the beginning, the `node-sass` package was used to compile `.scss` files
to CSS. This package is [deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) for some time and we're gradually
replacing it with the [`sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) package which doesn't rely on native
code and therefore offers less compatibility problems, but has some of its own quirks.

In the first phase both `node-sass` and `sass` will be supported. Later on, we're going to make a permanent switch
after which `node-sass` will not work anymore.

These are the steps required to start using `sass` today in your project:

1. remove `node-sass` from `package.json`
2. install `sass`
3. make the following changes in the root `index.scss` file:

- add `@use 'sass:math';` at the top of the file
- replace `cx-divide` function, after it's been imported

```scss
@use 'sass:math';

# define variables
...

@import '~cx/src/variables';

@function cx-divide($a, $b) {
    @return math.div($a, $b);
}
```

Voila, your project now compiles CSS using `sass`. No more annoying `node-sass` issues.

## 21.3.0

### Babel 7

The source code now uses the optional chaining operator. Please upgrade Babel to the latest version or add this plugin to your existing configuration.

### JSX runtime

This release contains a new version of `babel-preset-cx-env` plugin which uses the new React JSX transform.
This should result in slightly smaller bundle sizes and in some cases it's not required to import VDOM for React components.
For more information check [this post on the official React blog](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).

The new release also removes Babel plugins which are now part of the @babel/preset-env preset out of the box, i.e. `@babel/transform-object-spread`.

### Whitespace trimming on generated `cx` code

There are new version of `babel-plugin-cx-env` and `babel-plugin-transfrom-cx-jsx` which allow whitespace trimming in the generated code.
This might help a bit with the generated bundle sizes.

You can set this up in your `babel-config.js` file:

```javascript
{
  presets: [
    [
      "babel-preset-cx-env",
      {
        cx: {
          jsx: {
            trimWhitespace: true,
            trimWhitespaceExceptions: ["Md", "CodeSnippet", "CodeSplit"],
          },
          imports: {
            useSrc: true,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ];
}
```

For more information, check the NPM page for [babel-plugin-transform-cx-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-cx-jsx).

## 21.1.0

### Change in invokeParentMethod

Previously [`invokeParentMethod`](/concepts/controllers#-code-invokeparentmethod-code-) could be used to invoke Controller's own method. If the specified method was not found on current
Controller instance, parent instances would be checked until the one with the specified method is found.

With this change, `invokeParentMethod` now **skips** the current Controller instance and tries to invoke the specified method
in one of the parent instances, as the name suggests.
This can cause the code to break if, for example, `invokeParentMethod` was used in one of the inline event handlers:

```javascript
<div
  controller={{
    onSubmit(val) {
      console.log("val", val);
    },
  }}
>
  <Button
    onClick={(e, instance) => {
      let controller = instance.controller;
      // This will cause an error:
      // Uncaught Error: Cannot invoke controller
      // method "onSubmit" as controller is not assigned to the widget.
      controller.invokeParentMethod("onSubmit", 1);
    }}
    text="Submit"
  />
</div>
```

To fix this, make the following change in the `onClick` handler:

```javascript
onClick={(e, instance) => {
    let controller = instance.controller;
    // Use invokeMethod instead of invokeParentMethod
    controller.invokeMethod('onSubmit', 1);
}}
```

[`invokeMethod`](/concepts/controllers#-code-invokemethod-code-) has the same behaviour as the previous implementation of `invokeParentMethod`, hence it can be used as a fail-safe replacement for
`invokeParentMethod` in this version of CxJS.

## 20.1.0

### Format change for DateTimeField

`DateTimeField` now expects regular formats, e.g. `datetime;yyyyMMMdd` (previously only `yyyyMMMdd` part was required).
This change enables non-standard, custom formats to be used.

## 19.1.0

### Babel 7

Starting with this version CxJS tooling requires Babel 7. New versions of the `babel-preset-cx-env`, `babel-plugin-transform-cx-jsx`,
and `babel-plugin-transform-cx-imports` packages do not support Babel 6 anymore.

These are the steps required to migrate your applications to Babel 7:

In `package.json`, update the following packages:

- `"babel-core"` => `"@babel/core": "^7.2.2"`,
- `"babel-preset-env"` => `"@babel/preset-env": "^7.2.3"`
- `"babel-polyfill"` => `"@babel/polyfill": "^7.2.5"`

In `babel.config`, replace `useBuiltIns: true` with `useBuiltIns: 'usage'`.

In `polyfill.js`, remove `import "babel-polyfill";`

If some other Babel plugins are used please make sure that these are also upgraded to versions which target Babel 7.

That's it.

#### TypeScript

One of the benefits that Babel 7 brings is support for TypeScript without the TypeScript tooling.
You can easily enable TypeScript in your project by installing the `@babel/preset-typescript` npm package
and registering the preset in your `babel.config` file.
You'll also have to tweak rules in `webpack.config.js` to support `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

Replace

```javascript
test: /\.js$/,
loader: 'babel-loader',
```

with:

```javascript
test: /\.(js|ts|tsx)$/,
loader: 'babel-loader',
```

You can now mix `.js`, `.ts` and `.tsx` files. However,
some of the [JSX in TS related quirks still apply](https://github.com/codaxy/cx-typescript-boilerplate).

## 18.12.0

### Functional Components and CxJS attributes

In order to support [store refs](https://github.com/codaxy/cxjs/issues/487) some changes were made to how
functional components handle CxJS-specific attributes such as `visible`, `controller` and `layout`.

For example, let's take a simple Tab component.

```javascript
const TabCmp = ({ prop1, children }) => (
  <cx>
    <div class="tab">{children}</div>
  </cx>
);
```

In previous versions of CxJS, if the `visible` attribute is used on a functional component,
it would be applied on all top-level elements.

```javascript
<TabCmp visible-expr="{tab} == 'tab1'">Tab1 Content</TabCmp>
```

This example above would expand to:

```javascript
<div visible-expr="{tab} == 'tab1'" class="tab">
  Tab1 Content
</div>
```

From this version, a PureContainer wrapper is added to all functional components and all CxJS-specific attributes
are applied on the wrapper element.

```javascript
<PureContainer visible-expr="{tab} == 'tab1'">
  <div class="tab">Tab1 Content</div>
</PureContainer>
```

Please note that this is a breaking change only if top-level component is `Rescope`, `Restate` or `DataProxy`.

With this change, both functional components and functional controllers can receive the `store` prop which
enables [an alternative syntax for accessing data using store references](https://github.com/codaxy/cxjs/issues/487).

## 17.12.0

### `babel-preset-env`

`babel-preset-env` is now a peer dependency of `babel-preset-cx-env`. Therefore it needs
to be installed in your project.
This change enables the `babel-preset-env` package to be updated independently from the
`babel-preset-cx-env`
package.

```
npm install babel-preset-env --saveDev
yarn add babel-preset-env --dev
```

### `-bind`, `-tpl`, `-expr` syntax

Data-binding attributes can now be written in an alternative syntax with a dash instead of a colon, for
example `value:bind` instead of `value-bind`. Although not necessarily a breaking change, both methods are
supported which solves a long standing problem of syntax errors that [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) reports if XML namespaces are used inside JSX.

## 17.7.0

This release adds support for CxJS applications with an extremely short start up time such as [CxJS Hacker
News](https://github.com/codaxy/cxjs-hackernews).
Bigger applications will improve startup time through incremental app loading and adopting [the app shell
architecture](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell).

In order for us to support minimal application shells some internal CxJS dependencies had to be broken.

### Confirmation Dialogs

The `Button` requires `MsgBox` and `Window` components in order to support user confirmation dialogs.
This (`confirm`) function is not always necessary, but when needed. it's better to load these additional
classes
after the application launch.

In order to enable CxJS based confirmation dialogs, use the `enableMsgBoxAlerts` method.
Otherwise, the browser default `prompt` dialog will appear.

To enable the confirmation function on application startup, use the following snippet:

```javascript
import { enableMsgBoxAlerts } from "cx/widgets";

enableMsgBoxAlerts();
```

### Tooltips

Tooltips are not automatically loaded anymore. The following example will not work because
tooltips first need to be enabled using the `enableTooltips` method.

```jsx
<div tooltip="Some tooltip" />
```

Use the following code to enable tooltips:

```javascript
import { enableTooltips } from "cx/widgets";

enableTooltips();
```

### Culture-Sensitive Number, Date and Currency Formatting

Culture-sensitive formats for dates and numbers are not automatically registered.
Formatting is auto-enabled if `NumberField`, `DateField` or any other culture dependent widget is used;
otherwise it needs to be enabled using the `enableCultureSensitiveFormatting` method.

```javascript
import { enableCultureSensitiveFormatting } from "cx/ui";

enableCultureSensitiveFormatting();
```

### Fat Arrow Expansion

In order to support fat arrows in expressions CxJS includes a transformer which rewrites fat arrows into
the standard function notation. This allows fat arrows to be used in Internet Explorer and older
versions of Safari, like in the following example.

```jsx
<div text:expr="{data}.filter(a=>a.value > 10).join(', ')" />
```

Code from the snippet above will not work in IE anymore because fat arrow expansion is now optional and
needs to be enabled using the `enableFatArrowExpansion` method.

```javascript
import { enableFatArrowExpansion } from "cx/data";

enableFatArrowExpansion();
```

### Enable All

For apps that do not use code-splitting and the developers want to enable all internal dependencies,
you may use `enableAllInternalDependencies` and everything will be as it was in previous versions.

```javascript
import { enableAllInternalDependencies } from "cx/widgets";

enableAllInternalDependencies();
```

## 17.4.0

We're proud to announce that we obtained ownership of the `cx` package at
[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cx)
and therefore our `cx-core` package will be replaced with `cx` and deprecated.

To migrate your apps, please do the following:

In `package.json` replace `cx-core` with `cx`.

```
yarn remove cx-core
yarn add cx
```

Additionally, if `babel-plugin-transform-cx-imports` is used with `useSrc` option,
in `webpack.config.js` `cx` package should be whitelisted
instead of `cx-core` in the `babel-loader` configuration.

```js
test: /\.js$/,
loader: 'babel-loader',
include: /(app|cx)/, //previously (app|cx-core)
```

If `cx-core` reference is used in `.scss` files, replace it with `cx`.

```scss
@import "~cx/src/variables"; //cx-core => cx
@import "~cx/src/index"; //cx-core => cx
```

After you're done, please upgrade all Cx related packages to the latest version.

```bash
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

Also, upgrade `cx-cli` tools globally.

```bash
yarn global add cx-cli
```

That's it.

The `cx-core` package will continue to work, but we recommend that all users to switch
to the new package. The benefit of this change is that the code completion will now work as IDEs will now be
able to find the `cx` package.
