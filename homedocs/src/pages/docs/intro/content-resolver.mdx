# ContentResolver

<ImportPath path="import { ContentResolver } from 'cx/widgets';" />

`ContentResolver` dynamically resolves content at runtime based on data. Use it when the content to display is unknown at build time, depends on data values, or needs to be lazy loaded.

<CodeExample code={ContentResolverExampleCode}>
  <ContentResolverExample client:load />
</CodeExample>

## How It Works

1. The `params` prop binds to a value in the store
2. When `params` changes, `onResolve` is called with the new value
3. `onResolve` returns the widget configuration to render
4. For async loading, `onResolve` can return a Promise
5. Children are displayed as default content while loading

## Structured Params

The `params` prop can be a structured object with multiple bindings:

```jsx
<ContentResolver
  params={{
    type: m.fieldType,
    required: m.isRequired,
  }}
  onResolve={({ type, required }) => {
    // resolve based on multiple parameters
  }}
/>
```

When any of the bound values change, `onResolve` is called with the updated object.

## Configuration

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `params` | `any` | Parameter binding. Can be a single value or structured object. Content is recreated when params change. |
| `onResolve` | `function` | Callback taking `params` and returning widget configuration or a Promise. |
| `mode` | `string` | How resolved content combines with children: `replace`, `prepend`, or `append`. Default is `replace`. |
| `loading` | `boolean` | Writable binding set to `true` while a Promise is resolving. |
| `children` | `any` | Default content displayed while `onResolve` Promise is loading. |
