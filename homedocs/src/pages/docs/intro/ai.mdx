# AI

CxJS documentation is optimized for AI coding assistants and large language models (LLMs). We provide machine-readable documentation files that help AI tools understand the framework and generate accurate CxJS code.

## LLMs.txt Files

Following the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) standard, CxJS provides documentation in formats optimized for AI consumption:

| File | Description | Use Case |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| [llms.txt](/llms.txt) | Index with links to all documentation pages | Quick overview and navigation |
| [llms-small.txt](/llms-small.txt) | Essential documentation (~100KB) | Fast context loading, basic usage |
| [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) | Complete documentation (~500KB) | Comprehensive reference, advanced features |

### Usage with AI Assistants

When working with AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor, you can:

1. **Reference the documentation URL** - Point the AI to `https://cxjs.io/llms-full.txt` for complete framework knowledge
2. **Include in system prompts** - Add the llms-small.txt content to your AI assistant's context for CxJS-aware code generation
3. **Use with RAG systems** - Index the documentation for retrieval-augmented generation

## CxJS Skill for Coding Agents

A dedicated CxJS skill for AI coding agents is coming soon. This skill will provide:

- Deep understanding of CxJS patterns and best practices
- Accurate code generation for widgets, forms, grids, and charts
- TypeScript-first approach with proper type inference
- Integration with popular AI coding tools

Stay tuned for updates.
