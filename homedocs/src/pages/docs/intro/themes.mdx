# Themes

<OnThisPage />

CxJS offers two theming approaches: a modern **CSS variables theme** for runtime customization, and **classic themes** with compile-time SCSS configuration.

## cx-theme-variables (Recommended)

The [`cx-theme-variables`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cx-theme-variables) theme uses CSS custom properties, enabling runtime theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode) without recompiling SCSS. It supports presets, tweaks, dynamic themes, and dark mode out of the box. Preview it in the [Theme Editor](/themes).

```bash
npm install cx-theme-variables
```

```tsx
import "cx-theme-variables/dist/reset.css";
import "cx-theme-variables/dist/widgets.css";
import "cx-theme-variables/dist/charts.css";
import "cx-theme-variables/dist/svg.css";
```

Or import from SCSS source:

```scss
@use "cx-theme-variables/src/index";
```

For presets, tweaks, dark mode, dynamic themes, and CSS variable overrides, see the [detailed documentation](/docs/concepts/css-variables-theme).

## Classic Themes

Classic themes use SCSS variables that are resolved at compile time. They produce smaller CSS output but require recompilation to change. See them in action at the [CxJS Gallery](https://gallery.cxjs.io/).

| Theme           | Package                 | Description                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Aquamarine      | `cx-theme-aquamarine`   | Clean, modern theme with aquamarine accents |
| Material        | `cx-theme-material`     | Google Material Design inspired theme   |
| Material Dark   | `cx-theme-material-dark`| Material Design dark variant            |
| Frost           | `cx-theme-frost`        | Light theme with subtle blue tones      |
| Dark            | `cx-theme-dark`         | Dark theme for low-light environments   |
| Space Blue      | `cx-theme-space-blue`   | Dark blue theme                         |
| Packed Dark     | `cx-theme-packed-dark`  | Compact dark theme for data-dense UIs   |

```bash
npm install cx-theme-aquamarine
```

```scss
@use "cx-theme-aquamarine/src/index";
```

For customization with variables, state style maps, and CSS overrides, see the [detailed documentation](/docs/concepts/classic-themes).
