# NonOverlappingRect

<ImportPath path="import { NonOverlappingRect, NonOverlappingRectGroup } from 'cx/svg';" />

<OnThisPage />

The `NonOverlappingRect` and `NonOverlappingRectGroup` components are used to automatically hide overlapping elements. This is commonly used for chart labels where showing all labels would create visual clutter.

In this example, labels that would overlap other labels are automatically hidden. Try dragging markers around to see how the visibility updates dynamically.

<CodeExample code={NonOverlappingRectExampleCode}>
  <NonOverlappingRectExample client:load />
</CodeExample>

## How It Works

1. Wrap your content in a `NonOverlappingRectGroup`
2. Use `NonOverlappingRect` around elements that should not overlap
3. The system calculates bounding boxes and hides elements that would overlap

## Configuration

### NonOverlappingRectGroup

Container that manages overlap detection for its children.
