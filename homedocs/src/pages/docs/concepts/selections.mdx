# Selections

Selections enable users to select one or more items from widgets like Grid, List, and charts. CxJS provides three selection models, each suited for different use cases.

## Comparison

| Model                                                   | Storage                            | Best for                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [KeySelection](key-selection)           | Key value(s) in separate variable  | Selection survives data updates |
| [SimpleSelection](simple-selection)     | Entire object in separate variable | Simple single select            |
| [PropertySelection](property-selection) | Boolean flag on each record        | Checkbox lists, toggles         |

## How to Choose

Use [KeySelection](key-selection) when selection needs to survive data refreshes. Keys remain stable while object references change after updates.

Use [SimpleSelection](simple-selection) for simple single-select scenarios where you need immediate access to the selected object.

Use [PropertySelection](property-selection) for checkbox-based UIs where each record tracks its own selection state.
