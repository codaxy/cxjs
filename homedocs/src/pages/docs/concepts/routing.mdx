# Routing

CxJS includes built-in routing for single-page applications. Define routes that render content based on the URL, navigate programmatically, and handle deep linking.

Both hash-based (`#/path`) and `pushState` based (`/path`) navigation modes are supported.

## Key Components

| Component                             | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Route](/core/route)                  | Conditionally renders content when the URL matches a pattern               |
| [RedirectRoute](/core/redirect-route) | Automatically redirects when the URL matches                               |
| [Url](/core/url)                      | Helper class for URL path manipulation and resolution                      |
| [History](/core/history)              | Programmatic navigation with `pushState`, confirmations, and subscriptions |

## Basic Setup

```tsx
import { Route } from "cx/widgets";
import { History } from "cx/ui";

// Connect History to store
History.connect(store, "url");

// Define routes
<Route route="~/" url={m.url}>
  <HomePage />
</Route>
<Route route="~/about" url={m.url}>
  <AboutPage />
</Route>
```

The `~/` prefix resolves to your application's base path, making routes portable across different deployment paths.
