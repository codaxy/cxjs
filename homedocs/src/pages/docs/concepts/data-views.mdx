# Data View Components

All application data in CxJS is stored inside a central [Store](/docs/core/store). While convenient for global state, accessing deeply nested paths or working with collections can become cumbersome. Data View components wrap parts of the widget tree and provide a modified view of the Store data, making it easier to work with specific areas of the data model.

## Comparison

| Component                                | Purpose                                           | Use case                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Repeater](/docs/data/repeater)          | Renders children for each record in a collection  | Lists, tables, any repeated content   |
| [Rescope](/docs/data/rescope)            | Selects a common prefix for shorter binding paths | Deeply nested data structures         |
| [Sandbox](/docs/data/sandbox)            | Multiplexes data based on a dynamic key           | Tabs, routes with isolated page data  |
| [PrivateStore](/docs/data/private-store) | Creates an isolated store for a subtree           | Reusable components with local state  |
| [DataProxy](/docs/data/data-proxy)       | Creates aliases with custom getter/setter logic   | Computed values, data transformations |
| [Route](/docs/core/route)                | Renders children when URL matches a pattern       | Page routing, exposes `$route` params |

## How Data Views Work

Each Data View component exposes the same interface as the Store to its children, but can introduce additional properties. For example, Repeater adds `$record` and `$index` for each item in the collection, Route exposes `$route` with matched URL parameters, while Sandbox might expose `$page` for route-specific data. These additional properties are only accessible within the scope of that Data View, allowing child widgets to bind to them just like any other Store data.

## How to Choose

Use [Repeater](/docs/data/repeater) when you need to render a list of items from an array.

Use [Rescope](/docs/data/rescope) when working with deeply nested data and you want shorter binding paths.

Use [Sandbox](/docs/data/sandbox) when you need to switch between different data contexts based on a key (e.g., tabs, route parameters).

Use [PrivateStore](/docs/data/private-store) (also known as Restate) when you need completely isolated state that doesn't affect the global store.

Use [DataProxy](/docs/data/data-proxy) when you need to transform data or create computed aliases with custom getter/setter logic.

Use [Route](/docs/core/route) when you need to conditionally render content based on URL and access matched route parameters.

## Store Mutation

By default, Data View components write aliased data (like `$record`, `$page`) back to the parent store, all the way up to the global store. Regular data bindings propagate normally regardless of these settings.

This default behavior is often fine and can improve performance by avoiding data copying. However, sometimes you want to prevent aliased fields from polluting your data. For example, when rendering a tree with nested Repeaters, fields like `$record` and `$index` would be written into your tree nodes.

Two properties control this behavior:

- `immutable` - Prevents aliased data from being written to the parent store.
- `sealed` - Prevents child Data Views from writing aliased data to this Data View's store.
