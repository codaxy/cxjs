Codaxy d.o.o. ("Codaxy", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your personal data and ensuring transparency about how it is processed. This Privacy Notice explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, when we may share it, and the rights you have regarding your personal data.

This Notice applies to all visitors of our websites, including codaxy.com, cx-reports.com, cxo.codaxy.com, cxjs.io and other pages we operate ("websites").

If you have any questions, you may contact us at [privacy@codaxy.com](mailto:privacy@codaxy.com).

## 1. Personal Data We Collect

We collect personal data that you provide directly to us and data that is collected automatically through your use of our websites.

### 1.1. Data You Provide to Us

When you contact us through a form, we collect the information you provide, such as your email address and the content of your message. When you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address to deliver updates and communications. The newsletter subscription is supported by HubSpot, our marketing automation provider.

When you enter your email address into a newsletter subscription field on our websites, your email address is transmitted to HubSpot even before you press the final Submit button.

This behavior is inherent to HubSpot's subscription component. HubSpot processes this data strictly on Codaxy's behalf and solely for newsletter delivery and communication purposes.

Codaxy does not sell, transfer, or disclose email addresses or other user-submitted personal data to any other third party.

### 1.2. Data Collected Automatically

When you visit our websites, your device automatically sends technical information that helps us understand user behavior and improve the quality and performance of our content. This may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, approximate location based on IP, pages viewed, scrolling behavior, click patterns and general usage statistics.

This information is collected by tools such as:

- Google Analytics 4
- Hotjar
- LinkedIn Insight Tag
- Facebook Pixel
- Cloudflare Browser Insights

These providers collect technical identifiers directly from your browser when their scripts are loaded on our websites. Codaxy does not send them any personal data that you manually enter (such as email addresses or contact-form messages).

### 1.3. Cookies and Similar Technologies

Our websites use cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons and similar technologies to provide functionality, secure the websites, understand usage patterns and measure the effectiveness of marketing activities.

Details are provided in our [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy).

## 2. How We Use Your Personal Data

We use personal data to respond to inquiries you submit, provide information about our products and services, deliver newsletters to subscribers and improve the functionality and performance of our websites.

We analyze aggregated and anonymized usage data to understand how visitors use our content, identify popular pages, improve user experience and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

Marketing platforms such as LinkedIn and Meta may help us reach audiences who may be interested in Codaxy content, but Codaxy itself does not transfer user-submitted personal data to these platforms.

Where processing is based on your consent—such as analytics or marketing cookies—you may withdraw your consent at any time.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

We process personal data under one or more of the following legal grounds:

- **Legitimate interest**, such as responding to inquiries, operating secure websites and analyzing aggregated usage
- **Consent** for newsletter delivery and optional analytics/marketing cookies
- **Legal obligation**, where required under the applicable Personal Data Protection Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina ("Zakon o zaštiti ličnih podataka")
- Where GDPR applies (for visitors from the EU), we comply with GDPR principles and requirements

## 4. Sharing of Personal Data

### 4.1. HubSpot Use

We use HubSpot manually provided personal data strictly for newsletter delivery and communication purposes. If you subscribe to our newsletter, your email address will be stored and processed in HubSpot (EU region only) for the purpose of sending you updates and news about our products and services. HubSpot does not receive any other personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily.

You may unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the email or by contacting us at [privacy@codaxy.com](mailto:privacy@codaxy.com).

All newsletter-related data is hosted in the EU. We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

### 4.2. Third Party Services for Collecting Technical Identifiers from Your Browser

We use several third-party services that collect technical identifiers directly from your browser when you visit our websites. These include Google Analytics 4, Hotjar, LinkedIn Insight Tag, Facebook Pixel and Cloudflare Browser Insights. Codaxy does not control which identifiers these third parties collect or how they use them; their processing is governed by their own privacy policies.

We may disclose personal data if required by law or in response to lawful requests from authorities.

Otherwise, Codaxy does not share personal data that you manually provide (such as email addresses or the content of contact-form messages) with any third parties.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Notice. For example:

- Contact-form messages are generally kept for up to 12 months
- Newsletter subscription data is kept until you unsubscribe
- Analytics and performance data are retained according to the settings of the respective platforms (e.g., GA4 default retention periods)

Backup archives may retain some information for limited additional periods before being securely overwritten.

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to request access to your personal data, request correction of inaccurate information, request deletion, restrict certain forms of processing, object to processing or withdraw consent when processing is based on consent.

To exercise your rights, contact us at [privacy@codaxy.com](mailto:privacy@codaxy.com). We will respond as soon as we can, certainly within the timeframes required by applicable data protection laws.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our websites are not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at [privacy@codaxy.com](mailto:privacy@codaxy.com).

## 8. Updates to This Privacy Notice

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations.

The updated version will be published on this page and will become effective once posted. We encourage you to review this Notice periodically.
