This Cookie Policy explains how Codaxy d.o.o. ("Codaxy", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our websites, including codaxy.com, cx-reports.com, cxjs.io, cxo.codaxy.com and other pages we operate ("websites").

It describes what these technologies are, why we use them, and the choices you have regarding their use.

If you have any questions about this policy, you may contact us at [privacy@codaxy.com](mailto:privacy@codaxy.com).

## 1. What Cookies Are

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to enable essential website functions, improve performance, understand user behavior and support marketing and communication activities.

In addition to cookies, our websites may use other technologies such as web beacons, tracking pixels, tags and scripts. These technologies operate in a similar way and help us understand how visitors use our websites or whether certain features or emails have been opened or interacted with.

## 2. Why We Use Cookies

We use cookies to ensure that our websites operate securely and efficiently, to understand how visitors interact with our content, to enhance usability and to support marketing and communication activities. Some cookies are essential for the websites to function, and these cannot be disabled. Others are optional and used only if you agree with them.

## 3. Types of Cookies We Use

### Essential Cookies

Essential cookies are necessary for the websites to function correctly. They enable basic features such as page navigation, secure access, load balancing and essential performance behavior. Without these cookies, parts of the websites may not work properly.

### Analytics and Performance Cookies

We use analytics cookies to understand how visitors interact with our websites and to improve their performance. These cookies help us learn which pages are visited most often, how long visitors stay on a page and whether any issues occur while browsing.

Tools that perform this function include Google Analytics 4 and Cloudflare Browser Insights. These providers collect aggregated technical data directly from your browser.

### Behavioral Analytics Cookies

We use Hotjar to better understand how individual pages are used, such as where visitors click, how far they scroll and how they navigate. This information helps us identify usability improvements and optimize user experience.

### Marketing and Advertising Cookies

We use marketing technologies to help evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing activities and to reach audiences who may be interested in our products.

Tools such as the LinkedIn Insight Tag and the Facebook Pixel allow these platforms to recognize when a visitor has interacted with our websites. These tools collect information directly from your device when their scripts load on our pages.

Codaxy does not send them personal data that users enter manually (such as email addresses).

### Newsletter and Communication Cookies (HubSpot)

Our websites include newsletter subscription forms supported by HubSpot. When you enter your email address into a subscription field, your email address is transmitted to HubSpot even before you press the final Submit button.

This is part of the technical operation of HubSpot's form component. HubSpot uses this information strictly on Codaxy's behalf and solely for newsletter delivery and communication management.

Codaxy does not transfer email addresses or any other manually entered data to any third party other than HubSpot.

## 4. Cookies Set by Third Parties

Some cookies on our websites are set by third-party providers whose services we use for analytics, behavior tracking, marketing or communication. These third parties collect technical identifiers directly from your browser when you visit our websites. Codaxy does not control which identifiers they collect or how they use them.

The primary third-party providers include:

- Google Analytics 4
- Hotjar
- LinkedIn
- Meta (Facebook Pixel)
- Cloudflare
- HubSpot

These providers process data under their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them for more information.

## 5. Your Choices and How to Control Cookies

You have the right to choose whether to accept or reject optional cookies. Essential cookies cannot be disabled as they are required for core website functionality. You may control cookies in the following ways:

- Through your browser settings, where you can block or delete cookies
- Through any cookie banner or preference tool provided on our websites
- By withdrawing consent for optional cookies at any time

Please note that blocking certain cookies may affect your browsing experience or limit some interactive features. Most browsers provide detailed instructions in their help sections on how to control cookies.

## 6. Use of Web Beacons and Tracking Pixels

From time to time, we may use web beacons or tracking pixels to determine whether content on our websites has been viewed or whether an email has been opened. These technologies often work in conjunction with cookies. If you disable cookies, some pixel-based features may not function properly.

## 7. Updates to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the cookies we use or due to legal, regulatory or technical developments. When we update this policy, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

We encourage you to revisit this page periodically to stay informed about our use of cookies and similar technologies.
