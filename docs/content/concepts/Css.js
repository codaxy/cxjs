        # CSS

        This article covers multiple aspects related to styling of Cx in your application:

        * [Sass/SCSS](#sass)
        * [Class prefixes and BESM convention](#class-prefixes-and-besm-convention)
        * [Variables and Maps](#variables-and-maps)
        * [Importing SCSS files](#importing-scss-files)
        * [Themes](#themes)
        * [Components](#components)

        ## Sass

        Styling of Cx widgets is implemented using Sass/SCSS. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
        stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets and it's a professional CSS extension language.
        SCSS stands for Sassy CSS and it's a flavor of Sass which uses CSS-like (bracket based)
        syntax instead of indentation.

        SCSS files are compiled into CSS using webpack's `sass-loader` which under the hood uses `node-sass`
        library.

        Before going further, users not familiar with Sass should learn the [basic concepts](http://sass-lang.com/guide), such as variables
        and mixins.

        ## Class prefixes and BESM convention

        All generated CSS classes use the default prefix `cx`. Furthermore, CSS classes generated
        for each component follow the Block Element State Mod (BESM) convention.

        <CodeSplit>

            BESM convention is inspired by [the BEM convention](http://getbem.com/naming/), which
            provides guidelines for naming CSS classes and performance. BESM convention is slightly
            more relaxed and more suitable for components which appear in many different states.

            0. Block element classes start with the prefix `cxb-`, e.g. `.cxb-window`.
            0. Element classes start with the prefix `cxe-` and include the parent block name, e.g.
            `.cxe-window-header`.
            0. State modifiers start with the prefix `cxs-`, e.g. `.cxs-disabled`.
            0. Style modifiers (mods) start with the prefix `cxm-`, e.g. `.cxm-glow`.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code">{`
            ///HTML generated by the ColorField widget
            <div class="cxb-colorfield cxs-edit-mode cxs-visited">
                <input
                    class="cxe-colorfield-input"
                    type="text"
                    id="fld-1859"
                    value="#f88"
                >
                <div class="cxe-colorfield-tool">
                    <div style="background-color: rgba(255, 136, 136, 1);"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            ///HTML generated by the Button widget with mod="primary"
            <button class="cxb-button cxm-primary" type="button">
                Primary
            </button>

            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        By the convention, each component is represented by a single block-level element - `.cxb-`.
        Each block may contain sub-elements which do not have any standalone meaning.
        Element classes always include the name of the block and (in Cx) use a different prefix - `.cxe-`.
        Components and elements may be in different states, which is represented by appending
        additional CSS classes - state classes - `.cxs`. Finally, `.cxm-` classes are appended to the block
        in order to change the component's appearance, which is also known as modding.

        By using the BESM convention, Cx widgets are made very readable and easy to debug.
        Nevertheless, it's not mandatory to use the same convention in your application.

        ## Variables and Maps

        Cx offers many variables which can be used to tweak the default appearance of Cx widgets.

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
                $cx-default-font-size: 16px;
                $cx-default-input-border-color: #c2dad9;
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        Some widgets have many different states and each state has its own visual properties.
        Cx uses Sass maps to represent style rules corresponding to each state.

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
            $cx-list-item: (
                default: (),
                hover: (
                    background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.1),
                    outline: none
                ),
                hover-focus: (
                    background-color: rgba(123,190,255, 0.15),
                    outline: none,
                ),
                selected: (
                    background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.2),
                ),
                selected-focus: (
                    background-color: rgba(123,190,255, 0.4),
                    outline: none
                ),
                active: (
                ),
                disabled: (
                    color: rgba(128, 128, 128, .5),
                    background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, .1),
                    cursor: default
                )
            ) !default;
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        CSS overrides should be used to set the style rules that are not 
        covered with the existing variables and maps.

        ### Global rules

        Sass maps are used for defining global rules. If you need to
        add/override just a couple of rules, use `cx-deep-map-merge` instead
        of replacing the entire map.

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
            $cx-element-style-map: cx-deep-map-merge($cx-element-style-map, (
               html: (
                  background: #222
               ),
               a: (
                  text-decoration: none
               )
            ));
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>


        ## Importing SCSS files

        Here, we'll assume that your application is also using SCSS. The process
        of importing Cx SCSS files needs to be performed in a below specified order, if you need to tweak the
        appearance of Cx widgets in your application. 

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
            // here you have a chance to override Cx variables

            @import "~cx-core/src/variables"; 

            // you can override state-style-maps here, before importing CSS

            //$cx-include-global-rules: false; //include global rules (reset)
            //$cx-include-all: true; //include CSS for all components
            @import "~cx-core/src/index";

            //if $cx-include-all is set to false
            //@include cx-textfield(); //include only the components you need
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        ## Themes

        Cx offers a couple of [themes](http://cxjs.io/themes) out of the box.
        In order to use a theme, install its npm package, e.g.

        ```
        npm install cx-theme-dark
        ```

        Then, import Cx styles from the package: 

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
            ...
            @import "~cx-theme-dark/src/variables";
            ...
            @import "~cx-theme-dark/src/index";
            ...
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        Beside CSS, a theme may include JavaScript changes as well. Because of this, the theme's
        `index.js` file needs to be imported at the JavaScript's entry point of your Cx application.

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
                import "cx-theme-frost/src";
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>


        ## Components

        Component-related SCSS code is placed next to the component JS implementation.
        For example, the `Button` component is implemented in `src/widgets/Button.js` and the
        same folder contains `Button.scss` and `Button.variables.scss`, which are related to styling.

        Components that offer unique styling have a separate file for defining variables (e.g. `Button.variables.scss`).
        Simpler components may not need a separate file for variables, and will only include a single
        SCSS file which outputs CSS classes required by the component.

        ### Subclassing Widgets

        Subclassing means creating new widgets based on existing ones.
        For example, let's create a new search field widget based on the text field widget.
        It should have round borders, no outer borders and a semi-transparent placeholder color.

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet lang="scss">{`
                $searchfield-state-style-map: cx-merge-state-style-maps(
                  $cx-input-state-style-map, (
                    default: (
                      border-radius: 10px,
                      border-width: 0
                    )
                  )
                );

                @include cx-textfield('searchfield', $searchfield-state-style-map,
                  $placeholder: (
                    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
                  )
                );
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        You can use the new widget by specifying the base class:

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet>{`
                <TextField baseClass="searchfield" ... />
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        Better yet, you can subclass a new `SearchField` from the `TextField` widget in JavaScript as well.

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet>{`
                class SearchField extends TextField {}
                SearchField.prototype.baseClass = 'searchfield';
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        After that, you can use it like this:

        <CodeSplit>
            <CodeSnippet>{`
                <SearchField ... />
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

    </Md>
</cx>;
