            Improve performance by detaching `PrivateStore` subtree from the rest of the page.
            Detached content renders in its own render loop and uses a `data` declaration to determine which changes can go in or out.
            Detached render loops break the use of `context`, so some advanced Cx features, such as layouts, may not work.
