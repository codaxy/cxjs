        # Widgets

        Widgets are considered building blocks of your application. A large application may contain thousands of
        interactive and interconnected widgets.

        Widgets have two primary functions:

        1. Present information to the user.
        2. Gather inputs from the user and dispatch information required for updating the application state.

        <CodeSplit>

            Similar to HTML, in the CxJS framework data views are defined using the [JSX syntax](~/intro/jsx) like the
            one shown
            in the next code snippet.

            <Content name="code">
                <Tab value-bind="$page.code.tab"  mod="code" tab="code"  text="Widgets" default />
                <CodeSnippet visible-expr="{$page.code.tab}=='code'">{`
                export const Main = <cx>
                    <main outerLayout={Layout}>
                        <Content name="aside" items={Contents} />
                        <ContentRouter />
                    </main>
                </cx>
            `}
                </CodeSnippet>
            </Content>
        </CodeSplit>

        There are a few specific rules related to CxJS:

        1. CxJS widget trees must be wrapped into the `&lt;cx&gt;` element.
        That is an instruction to Babel (JS compiler) to convert this section into CxJS widget configuration, instead of
        React function calls.

        2. HTML elements and widgets can be mixed. The rule is that widgets should start with an uppercase
        letter.

        3. Elements and widgets can contain additional instructions for layout, data binding, controllers etc.

        ## Store

        Widgets rely on the central data repository called `Store`.

        - Widgets use stored data to calculate data required for rendering (data binding process).
        - Widgets react on user inputs and update the store either directly (two-way bindings) or by dispatching
        actions which are translated into new application state (see Redux).
        - The Store sends change notifications which produce a new rendering of the widget tree and a DOM update.

        ## Application Loop

        <CodeSplit>
            <Content name="code">
                <Tab value-bind="$page.code.tab"  mod="code" tab="code"  text="app/index.js" default />
                <CodeSnippet>{`
               let store = new Store();
               let appEl = document.getElementById('app');
               let stop = startAppLoop(appEl, store, Main);
            `}
                </CodeSnippet>
            </Content>
        </CodeSplit>

        Application loop consists of three steps:

        1. Change the application state
        2. Render widgets and update DOM
        3. Capture user inputs or external events and convert them into state actions

        ## Widget Methods

        CxJS widgets are similar to React components in the way they define  its `render` method.

        <CodeSplit>

            ### `declareData`

            This method is used to report all bindable properties of the widget.

            ### `render`

            The `render` method returns virtual DOM representation of the widget.
            Note that the `&lt;cx&gt;` wrapper is not used inside the `render` method.

            <Content name="code">
                <Tab value-bind="$page.code.tab"  mod="code" tab="code"  text="Rectangle.js" default />
                <CodeSnippet>{`
               export class Rectangle extends BoundedObject {

                  declareData() {
                      return super.declareData({
                         anchors: undefined,
                         offset: undefined,
                         margin: undefined,
                         padding: undefined
                      }, ...arguments)
                   }

                  render(context, instance, key) {
                     var {data} = instance;
                     var {bounds} = data;
                     if (!bounds.valid())
                        return null;
                     return <g key={key}>
                        <rect x={bounds.l}
                              y={bounds.t}
                              width={bounds.width()}
                              height={bounds.height()}
                              style={data.style}
                              className={data.classNames}
                           />
                        {this.renderChildren(context, instance)}
                     </g>;
                  }

                  ...
               }

               // This enables the use of styling properties (style, class/className)
               Rectangle.prototype.styled = true;
            `}
                </CodeSnippet>
            </Content>
        </CodeSplit>

        It's important to understand all parameters passed here:

        1. The `context` parameter is used to pass information from parents to children and vice-versa.
        For example, chart control is a complex widget made of sub-elements such as axes and series.
        When a chart is rendered, its axes are registered in the context, so when the series are rendered they can use
        axis information from the context.

        2. Same widgets can be rendered multiple times at multiple locations. Imagine a table where each row
        has the same structure, but presents different data. The `instance` parameter contains `data`, `store` and
        other important properties related to the particular instance being rendered.

        3. The `key` parameter holds an identifier specific to the given widget instance. Keys are used to match
        DOM elements between subsequent rendering cycles. Keys should be set on all top level
        elements returned by the render function. Widgets generally return a single top element, however
        some widgets (like form fields) return multiple top level elements (label, input).

        ### `explore`, `prepare` and `cleanup`

        The `explore` method is invoked first to evaluate data-bound attributes (`instance.data`)
        and explore children (gather information from them). If the `visible` property evaluates to `false`,
        the widget will not be rendered and all processing will stop.

        The `prepare` method is invoked afterwards to do additional preparation work
        before rendering. If `context` is used, this is an opportunity to get additional information for the widget.

        The `cleanup` method is invoked after rendering is finished to do any necessary cleanup work.
