        # JSX

        <CodeSplit>

            JSX is a syntax extension which enables HTML-like templates to be defined inside JavaScript code.
            JSX supports custom components and makes view templates stylish and effective.

            ## Babel

            [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a tool which compiles ECMAScript 6 and JSX into ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript).
            Babel has a plugin-based architecture which makes the transformation process very configurable.

            Babel compiles CxJS (JSX) into ECMAScript 5 using the `babel-plugin-transform-cx-jsx` plugin which is
            available for installation over [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

            If you take a look at the following example, you will see how JSX code is transformed into JS configuration
            objects.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code">{`
                <cx>
                    <div>
                        <TextField
                            value-bind="person.name"
                            required
                            label="Label" />
                    </div>
                </cx>

                //the code below is equivalent to the code above

                {
                    type: HtmlElement,
                    tag: 'div',
                    children: [{
                        type: TextField,
                        value: {
                            bind: 'person.name'
                        },
                        required: true,
                        label: 'Label'
                    }]
                 }
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        ## CxJS Specific Features

        All JSX code blocks related to CxJS must be wrapped into the `cx` root element.
        If the code is not wrapped in the `cx` root element
        it will be compiled using React's JSX compiler which will produce different results.

        ### Data-binding Attributes

        CxJS supports declarative data-binding using `-bind`, `:tpl` and `:expr` attribute suffixes.
        Bindings establish connections between widget properties and values in the Store[~/concepts/store]
        pointed by the binding's path. Whenever data changes, widgets are automatically updated.
        Special binding syntax enables very readable and developer-friendly view code.

        ### Conditional Rendering

        <CodeSplit>

            CxJS exposes the `visible` property on all elements.
            This property controls whether an element should or should not be rendered.
            If `visible` is set or evaluated to `false`, the element and its children will not be rendered. The
            application will behave as if the element does not exists. Check out the following example.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code" fiddle="pXZnFu2N">{`
                <div visible:expr="!{form.valid}">
                    Please correct all errors in the form and try again.
                </div>
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        ### Whitespace Handling

        <CodeSplit>

            Whitespace is sometimes ignored which can cause frustration for the developer.
            CxJS offers the `ws` attribute which instructs CxJS to keep the whitespace to make it more
            convenient for the developer.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code" fiddle="JYu5gf20">{`
                <a href="#" class="btn" ws>
                    <i class="fa fa-icon" /> Link
                </a>
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        ### `style` and `class`

        <CodeSplit>
            In React, `style` needs to be an object and `className` is a replacement for the `class` attribute.
            CxJS does not have these restrictions, and you can freely use `style` strings, as well as `class` or
            `className` attributes.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code" fiddle="enqL5Fok">{`
                <div class="well" style="width:100px; height: 100px; background: red"></div>
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        <CodeSplit>
            If `class` is used as an object, all keys whose corresponding values
            are equal to `true` will be added to the class list.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code">{`
                <div class={{
                    panel: true,
                    collapsed: { expr: '{panel.collapsed}' }
                }}>
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        ### Controller Callbacks

        <CodeSplit>

            In CxJS it will be common to see the attribute `onClick="save"`. This is a shorthand syntax which invokes
            the `save` method defined in the active controller.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code">{`
                <Button onClick="save">Save</Button>
            `}</CodeSnippet>
        </CodeSplit>

        ### Inner Text/HTML

        <CodeSplit>

            Another feature that makes CxJS stand out is the fact that in CxJS you can use `text` and `innerHtml`
            on all HTML container elements to set the inner content of the element.

            <CodeSnippet putInto="code">{`
                <h2 text-bind="person.name" />
                <div innerHtml-bind="html" />
            `}</CodeSnippet>

            The `innerHtml` property is very convenient for setting the inner content obtained through Markdown
            transformation or an AJAX call.
