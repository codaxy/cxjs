# CxJS

This is the main package of the [CxJS](https://cxjs.io/) framework. 

Cx is a feature-rich framework for building data-oriented web applications.

Cx is inspired by React and Angular and tries to offer the best features from both worlds.
Out of the box, Cx provides:
- a complete set of widgets 
- charts
- two-way data-binding options
- controllers
- layouts
- customizable appearance (Sass)

Cx is based on ES6 and JSX and requires `babel-plugin-transform-cx-jsx`. 
Cx widgets use React to render and update the DOM.
